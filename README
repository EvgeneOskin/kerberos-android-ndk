Kerberos Android NDK Sample Application

This is a sample Android NDK application which is a simple GUI wrapper
around the Kerberos kinit, klist, kvno, and kdestroy client 
applications. It includes cross-compiled versions of the MIT Kerberos
libraries as well as the CyaSSL Embedded SSL Library. It should be 
helpful to Android developers who are interested in using the 
Kerberos libraries in their own Android NDK Application.

By default, this package uses pre-built static Kerberos and CyaSSL 
libraries, which are needed in order to be linked to the KerberosApp 
application's native library (libkerberosapp.so).

===========================================================================
REQUIREMENTS:

Before building or installing this package, you must have the Android SDK
and NDK installed and set up on your system.

===========================================================================
BUILDING:

To build and install this package, run:

android update project -p . -s
ndk-build
ant debug

If you want to rebuild the pre-built Kerberos libraries, please use the
android-config.sh shell script. This will allow the MIT Kerberos libraries
to be cross-compiled for the Android platform. More detailed instructions 
can be found in the script comments.

===========================================================================
INSTALLING:

To install this package in a running Android emulator, run:

ant install

Before running the KerberosApp application, the user needs to install both
a Keytab file and a Kerberos configuration file. Reference the MIT Kerberos
documentation for guidelines for creating these files. Once created, they
can be installed using the adb push command, using:

adb push <local-file-path> <destination-file-path>

For example, to load a krb5.conf file from the current directory to an 
Android emulator under the /data/local/kerberos directory, run:

adb push krb5.conf /data/local/kerberos/

===========================================================================
DEFAULT STORAGE LOCATIONS:

The following locations are the default paths used for the Kerberos
sample application.

Kerberos config file:   /data/local/kerberos/krb5.conf
Credentials cache:      /data/local/kerberos/ccache/krb5cc_<uid>
Keytab:                 /data/local/kerberos/krb5.keytab
